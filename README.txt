HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the programming language used to build the internet. It is the standard language for web programming, along with CSS and JavaScript. This open-format, text-based type code is extremely versatile, and can be used to embed additional programming languages such as JavaScript. HTML is made up of different elements called tags that dictate the structure of the webpage that are then translated by a web browser into a user-friendly form.
